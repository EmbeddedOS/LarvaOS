# ATA Hard drive

## 1. What is ATA Hard Drive?

Hard drives are used to store data and information so that you can access and retrieve these data when you need them. Once the hard drive can no longer store data, you can purchase another hard drive to replace it. In a computer system, there are two types of ATA hard drive - **PATA hard drive** and **SATA hard drive**.

What is ATA hard drive? ATA is the abbreviation of Advanced Technology Attachment, it can also be called **IDE** or **PATA**. It is a **disk drive** (also called "**disk driver**") that integrates the **drive controller** directly on the drive itself. The computer can use an ATA hard disk without a specific controller to support the drive.

The motherboard must still support ATA connections, but a separate card is not required. The different types of ATA standards include `ATA-1`, `ATA-2`, `ATA-3`, `Ultra ATA`, `ATA/66`, and `ATA/100`. ATA hard driveâ€™s maximum data transfer rate is `133MB/s`.

### 1.1. IDE

The name **IDE** is often used interchangeably with ATA, but "**IDE**" actually refers to only the electrical specifications of the signals on the `40/80` pin disk cable. **ATA** is the proper name for the entire specification.

### 1.2. SATA and PATA

Recently a new standard for ATA data transmission has emerged. It was named **SATA**, and the previous well-known forms of ATA were retroactively renamed **PATA**, "to reduce confusion" -- while certainly causing it.

## 2. ATA PIO Mode

According to the ATA specs, PIO mode must alway be supported by all ATA-compliant drives as the default data transfer mechanism.

PIO mode uses a tremendous amount of CPU resources, because every byte of data transferred between the disk and the CPU must be sent though the CPU's `IO port bus` (not the memory). On some CPUs, PIO mode can still achieve actual transfer speeds of 16MB per sec, but no other processes on the machine will get any CPU time.

However, when a computer is just beginning to boot there are no other processes. So PIO mode is an excellent and simple interface to utilize during boot-up, until the system goes into multitasking mode.

### 2.1. Hardware

### 2.2. Master/Slave Drives

### 2.3. Primary/Secondary Bus

### 2.4. 400ns delays

### 2.5. Cache Flush

### 2.6. Bad Sectors

### 2.7. Detection and initialization

### 2.8. Addressing Modes

## 3. ATA read/write sectors

Since interrupts (like `INT 13h`) can not be called easily in protected mode or long mode, direct disk access though ports might be the only solution. The below code is example of subroutines to read and write disk sectors directly from the first hard disk (`80h`) in long mode using **CHS** and **LBA**.

### 3.1. ATA read sectors

#### 3.1.2. Read in LBA mode
