+ x86 (also known as 80x86 or 8086 family) is \
    a family of complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set architectures  \
    initially developed by Intel based on the Intel 8086 microprocessor and its 8088 variant.

+ The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit 8080 microprocessor, \
    with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address.
